Overview

This project will develop an advanced mobile system integrating AI-driven capabilities with cloud processing, social media connectivity, and IoT support. The focus is on building a functional, efficient, and scalable solution that balances on-device processing with cloud-based resources.

Prerequisites

Skills & Tools

The project requires experience in Python, machine learning, REST APIs, WebSockets, and basic Android development. Necessary tools include:

Python 3.9+

Android development setup

GitHub for version control

Cloud service account (AWS, GCP, or Azure)

System Architecture

The system is structured around three main components:

Mobile App (Frontend) – Runs on the Z Flip 4, managing user interactions and local processing.

Cloud Backend – Handles intensive processing, model hosting, and external API interactions.

Bridge System – Ensures seamless communication between mobile, cloud, and IoT devices.






Development Steps:

Finalize architecture diagrams.

Define API endpoints and security measures.

Establish authentication and data management processes.
